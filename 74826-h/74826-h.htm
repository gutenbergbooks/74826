<p>When Attila came storming into Europe,
his conquests may be said to
have given rise to two great sea-powers.
His rush on the north along the Baltic
shores probably caused so much pressure
on the continental English, that many of
them, all the Engle especially, left their
lands, found another country in Britain,
and gave it the name of England. It is
now, and has been for some centuries, the
mistress of the seas, both in commerce and
in war. But when Attila drove his war-plough
southward, he crossed the Alps,
and descended on the cities of the plain between
Trieste and the Po. When he reached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>Altinum, Aquileia, and the other towns bordering
on the lagoon, the Roman nobles,
many of whom might be called merchant princes,
and their dependants fled to Torcello,
to Rialto, and to other islands where,
before the conqueror came, they had established
depôts for their trading, where the
fishermen and boatmen were already in
their pay. When the Goths followed the
invading track of Attila, the emigration of
the Roman inhabitants of the mainland to
the lagoon continued year after year; and
out of this emigrant flight grew Venice, the
Queen of the Sea.</p>

<p>England was Teutonic, Venice was Roman;
and as in England the Teuton destroyed
the influence of Rome, so the Teutonic
invasion of Italy, with all its new
elements, never touched Venice. The Gothic
influence left her uninfluenced. She alone
in Italy was pure Roman. The English
race was mixed with the Celtic race, but
the Teutonic elements prevailed. But Venice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>was unmixed. She was always singularly
Roman right down to the dreadful days of
her final conquest, so that it may well be
said that Manin was <i>ultimus Romanorum</i>.
In constitution, in laws, in traditions, in the
temper of her citizens, in manners, in her
greatness, her splendour, even in her unbridled
luxury and her decay, she was Roman
to the end. Italy was transmuted by
the Goth, but not Venice.</p>

<p>But owing to her origin she was <i>Rome at
Sea</i>; and being on the edge of a sea which
naturally carried her war and trade to the
East, she was more of eastern than of
western Rome. Byzantium, not the Italian
Rome, was her nursing mother, and poured
into her the milk of her art, her commerce,
and her customs. By this, also, she remained
outside of Italy, and her position,
anchored in the sea off the Italian coast, is,
as it were, a symbol of her double relation
to Western and Eastern Rome. Whatever
change took place in her Roman nature was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>made by the spirit of the sea on which she
had made her home. Commerce was forced
upon her, and it was not difficult for her to
take it up, for the Roman senators and
patricians of Altinum, Padua, Concordia,
and Aquileia who took refuge on the islands,
had been traders before they founded Venice,
and only developed more fully in Venice
that commerce which they had practised
on the mainland. Aquileia had been for
years before the barbaric invasion the emporium
of a trade with Byzantium and
the Danube. The trade was transferred to
Venice. It did not, then, arise in Venice,
but it was so greatly increased during the
centuries that the new city held the east
in fee. From every port on the Mediterranean,
and from lands and seas beyond
that inland lake, the trade of east
and west poured into Venice. To protect
her commerce she became a sea-power.
Her struggle for centuries with the pirates
formed her navy and her seamen, both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>Venetians and mercenaries, into the mighty
instrument of naval war they became when
the strife with the pirates closed in victory.
But her captains, her senators, the great
dukes who led the navy into battle, led it
for the sake of her commerce, and were
themselves, as Shakespeare made Antonio,
“royal merchants,” such as they had been
of old in Padua, Altinum, and Aquileia;
and always Romans. Wherever then we
touch Venice we touch the sea out of which
she was born, by which she was nursed, and
which when she reached her full age, she
wedded and commanded.</p>

<p>To realize the origins of the city, and this
sea-spirit in her history and her life, to
recall in memory the centuries she lasted,
and to feel the sentiment of the splendid
sorrow, strife and glory of the tale, it is
well to row to Torcello, to climb to the
top of the cathedral tower, and to look out
from the low-arched windows, north and
south, east and west. The door used always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>to be open, and it was easy to reach the
upper chamber among the bells. Thence, as
the voyager gazes to the north and west, he
sees the high dim peaks of the Alpine chain
from whose passes the Hun and the Goth
descended. Below him stretches to the
sea the misty plain where the cities of the
old Venetia lay, which Attila advancing from
the east gave up to fire and to slaughter,
which Theodoric and Alboin afterwards
ruined more completely. From these and
from all the villages of the plain, the Roman
nobles with their dependants fled to
the islands of the lagoon which our voyager
sees spreading north and south at his feet
for many miles of blue and silver water.
Below the tower are the deep-grassed meadows
and dreary shores of Torcello which
the people of Altinum, a third part of whom
took flight from Attila, covered as the
years went on with noble palaces, streets,
bridges, and gardens. The cathedral they
built was built with the very marbles which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>had adorned, and the stones which had
raised, the churches and houses of Altinum.
Pillars, capitals, the pulpits, the chair of
the bishop, the marble screen of the choir,
the font, the pavement, belonged to their
church on the land. They were still Venetians.
As they increased, and as the emigration
from other cities continued, the
dwellers in the older Venetia colonized Mazzorbo,
Burano, Murano, and Malamocco.
The islands lie before our eyes as we look
from the southern windows of the tower.
And noblest of all, at the end of the long
slow curving line of the deep channel
among the marshes, is Rivo Alto on whose
islands the Venetians fixed their capital at
last.</p>

<p>There, tremulous in the sea-mist is the
shining expanse of water before the Ducal
Palace, and the towers of the great city, in
whose splendour and power ended the
misery and the struggle of the flight. No
view makes a deeper impression on the historian.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>But when that impression has been
realized, there will steal into his mind, if
he have with him the spirit of imagination,
another impression; one of curious charm,
a charm half of nature and half of humanity,
a charm not of the land, but of the sea.
In that charm there is the breath of the
salt winds and the life of the dark blue
waves which beyond Venice he sees from
Torcello breaking in flashing foam on the
Lido which defends the lagoon and shelters
the city. It is a charm that rises to his
heart, not only from the gay tossing of the
Adriatic, but from the quiet, glittering,
silver-gray expanse of the tidal lagoon in
which the islands sleep like cattle on the
meadows of the land. And of this charm
and all it means and has made Venice, I
shall attempt to write.</p>

<p>To write on Venice when many have
written so well on her; to describe her,
when she has been described from the
Angel that, so short a time ago, watched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>over her on the Campanile to the islands
on the far lagoon, seems almost an impertinence.
But I have loved Venice for many
years, and the record of any individual impressions
received from her may have the
interest which belongs to personal feeling.
Moreover, in this little essay I shall limit
myself to one subject—to the charm and
the life which are added to Venice by the
presence of the sea, to the influence which
the sea has had on her beauty, on the character
of her art, and on the imagination of
those who visit her. What influence the sea
had on her history—that immense subject—does
not come within the scope of this
essay. It is only concerned with her beauty,
her charm, as they are bound up with the
sea; it is not, save incidentally, concerned
with her history.</p>

<p>In her constitution, in her history, in
her people, in her position, in her art, and
in her sea-power and commerce, Venice,
among Italian towns, stands alone. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>only is built, not by the sea, but in the sea,
born not on the beach of ocean, but like
Aphrodité, from beneath her heart. It is
this difference which, entering into all her
lesser charms, gives them their distinction,
their wild, remote, and natural grace.
Other great towns belong to humanity and
art; even when they are sea-ports they are
of the land, and are the creation of the
land. But Venice, full of her own humanity,
wrought into beauty by the art of her
children, raised from the waves by the
labour of those who loved her, belongs only
to the sea, and seems to be the creation,
not only of man, but of great Nature herself.
Her streets are streams of the sea,
and were planned by the will of the sea.
The great path which, curling like a serpent,
divides her city; by which her palaces
of business, pleasure, and government were
built; on which her history displayed itself
for centuries in thanksgiving or sorrow, in
pomp or in decay; is a sea-river ebbing and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>flowing, and brings day by day, into her
midst, the winds of ocean for her life, the
fruits of ocean for her food, the mystery of
ocean for her beauty. This presence and
power of the living sea, running through
Venice like blood through a man, makes her
distinctive charm. It is the charm of the
life of Nature herself, added to the life of
her art and the life of her humanity.</p>

<p>There are times when this impression is
profound. To stand in the dawn, before
the city is awake, on the quay of the
Schiavoni, when the East beyond the Lido
is flushing like a bride, and the morning
star grows dim above the sea, is to forget
that the stones on which we stand, the
palaces and churches, bridges and towers,
were built by man’s wit or set up for his
business and his pleasure. They rose, we
think, out of the will and creative passion of
the Sea. The sky and the clouds descended
to bestow on them other light and colour
than those of the sea; the winds, in their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>playing, flung the bridges over the channels
of the tide and the sunlight knit them into
strength; but these were only the artists
that adorned, it was the sea that built, the
city.</p>

<p>Lest we should lose the power of this dream,
we will not watch the buildings grow solid
in the growing light, but keep our eyes on
the broad expanse of the lagoon, shimmering
in silver-gray out to the Port of Lido,
where the silver meets the leaping blue of the
Adriatic. The whole water-surface is alive,
though it seem asleep, with the swift rushing
of the tide. Around the angles of the
quay, over the marble steps, all along the
smooth stones of the wall, up the narrow
canals, looping past the piles, swirling
against the boats, the musical water ripples;
and in every motion, change, and
whirl, as in the main movement of the
whole lagoon, the life of Nature in this her
kingdom of the sea, full of force, pleasure,
and joy in her own loveliness, is overwhelming.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>It masters the spirit of the gazer, and
he becomes himself part of her sea-passion,
living in the stream of her sea-being. There
is silence everywhere. The quay is deserted,
and if a belated sailor pass by, the
sound of his footstep seems to mingle with
the crying of the sea birds and the plash
of the water. And in the silence, the impression
that Nature alone exists, that the
city is her work and that man is nothing,
is deepened for the moment into an unforgettable
reality.</p>

<p>A similar impression is made on the voyager
who rows at the dead of night, when
the sky is full of stars, out into the lagoon
half way between Venice and the Lido. The
city, with its scattered lights, has no clear
outlines; it rises like an exhalation from
the sea. The campaniles are white ghosts
that appeal to the dark blue heavens. Below
them, the crowd of buildings wavers in
the sea-mist like a shaken curtain. The
city, seen thus in the tremulous starlight,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>is, we think, a dream-conception which, in
high imagination, the God of the sea, resting
far below on his couch of pearl, has
thrown into such form as his wandering
will desires. No human art has made its
wonder.</p>

<p>Nearer to our eyes the islands lie outstretched
like sea-creatures, risen from the
depths to behold the stars and to rest from
their labours. The boats which lie at anchor
against the tide do not belong to man, but
are the chariots of Amphitrite and her crew.
And in the profound silence we hear the
deep breathing of the sea, a marvellous,
soft, universal sound; and perceive, half
awed and half delighted, the rise and fall
of her restless and pregnant breast. And
then man and his work no longer fill the
voyager’s imagination. He is absorbed into
Nature. The starry sky above, the living
sea below, are all he knows; and the sea
is the greatest, for it takes into its depths
the trembling of every star, and the white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>wavering of palace and tower, church and
bridge, and marble quay.</p>

<p>This impression, received in twilight or
at night, rules the thousand impressions
made in daylight by the art and life of
Venice. The “mighty Being” of the sea,
with its eternal mystery, penetrates and
pervades, and is mistress of the humanity
of the city. The ancient life of Venice was in
harmony with this, and what remains of
that life is still lovely and inspiring. The
modern life of Venice tends day by day to
be out of tune with this, and has violated
its beauty with amazing recklessness. No
reverence, no tenderness for the spirit of
the place has prevented a hundred desecrations,
which might have been avoided if
men had cared for beauty as well as for
commerce, if the men had even known what
beauty was, if they had even for an hour
realized the spirit of the place or the spirit
of the sea.</p>

<p>In days before the railway and its bridge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>had done away with the island apartness
of Venice, it seemed like a dream of Young
Romance to drop through the narrow canal
from Mestre on the mainland and come
upon the far-spread shimmer of the silvery
lagoon; and, rowing slowly, see, through
veils of morning mist, the distant towers,
walls, churches, palaces, rise slowly one
after another, out of the breast of the waters—silver
and rose and gold out of sapphire,
azure, and pale gray—a jewelled crown of
architecture on the head of slumbering
ocean. We forgot that fairyland had been
driven from the earth, and saw, or dreamed
we saw, the city of Morgan le Fay, or the
palaces of the Happy Isles where the Ever-young
found refuge in the sea—so lovely and
so dim the city climbed out of the deep.</p>

<p>That vision is gone, but even now there
are few visions more startling in their charm
than that which befalls the weary traveller
when coming out of the dark station he finds
himself suddenly upon the marble quay, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>a river of glittering water before his eyes,
fringed with churches, palaces, and gardens;
the broad stream alive with black gondolas,
shouts in his ears like the shouting of seamen;
and, lower in note and cry, but heard
more distinctly than all other sounds, the
lapping of the water on the steps of stone,
the rushing of the tide against the boats.
Midst all the wonders of the city, this it is
which first seizes on his heart. It is the
first note of the full melody of charm which
the sea in Venice will play upon his imagination
for many a happy day.</p>

<p>The waters that make her unique are in
themselves beautiful. Were they like those
of many lagoons, they might be stagnant,
and lose the loveliness of vital movement.
But they are tidal waters, and though the
ordinary tide does not rise much more than
a foot or two, yet its living rush is great,
and passes twice a day through the lagoons
and streets of Venice. It streams in at the
openings in the <i>lidi</i>, at the ports of Malamocco,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>Chioggia, Lido and Tre Porti, with
the force and swiftness of an impetuous
river, and these four water-systems, in
their meetings and retreats, fill the lagoon
with incessant movement, with clashing,
swirling, and sweeping currents. Then, the
tide does not always keep at this low level.
When the attractions of the sun and moon
combine, it rises higher and floods and
washes out the canals, and when the angry
south, blowing fiercely up Adria, has piled
up the waters at the head of the gulf, they
block in the falling tide. It cannot escape
from the lagoon, and it races from the Public
Gardens to the Dogana. There it divides
to fill the Giudecca and the Grand Canal
to the height of seven or eight feet. The
canals rise, the calli are flooded and the
squares, and the Piazza is a lake, and the
Piazzetta. Gondolas ply up to the doors of
Saint Mark’s and to the Ducal Palace. The
water falls as swiftly as it rises. There is
no lack of life in the Venetian lagoon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>Freshness, incessant change and joy minister
to the beauty of these waters.</p>

<p>They are of the sea, but the temper of
the sea in them is distinctive. The sea, uncircumscribed,
at the mercy of its own wild
nature, is beautiful or terrible, but it is too
vast, too noisy, too desirous of destruction,
even in calm too suggestive of anger, to
awaken that peculiar charm in which temperance,
quietude, a certain obedience or
sacrifice for use, are always elements. But
Venice lies in a gentle sea which loves to
give itself away. Her sea is guarded by long
banks of sand, pierced here and there by those
openings through which the tide arrives.
Within these is the wide lagoon, lying in a
sheltered place, dotted with islands sleeping
on silver sheets of shining water. And in the
midst is the city with all its towers. It is
thus penetrated and encompassed by the life
and beauty of the sea; but it is the sea tamed
to a love of rest; made temperate, even in
furious wind, by the barriers its own force
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>has built to shield its favoured daughter;
keeping its natural freedom and love of
movement, but obedient to the laws of help,
and sacrificing its reckless and destroying
will in order to do the work that rivers do
for men; preserving thus, along with its
own wild charm, the charm also of the great
streams that bless the earth. The sea, then
which makes Venice unique, has lost its
recklessness and terror. But it has not lost
its beauty. And its beauty has become as
it were spiritual, for it has subdued itself
to be more beautiful through service. It
was then not only in pride, but also in
gratitude and love, that the Doge wedded
the sea, and cast into her breast his ring,
and cried, “We espouse thee, sea, in token
of true and perpetual dominion.”</p>

<p>This gentle manner of the sea, in its service
through the narrow streets of the city,
in the narrow lanes of the lagoon, and over
its shallow banks, forced the boat the Venetians
built up into the shape of the gondola,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>and compelled the mode of rowing it.
And both these, being the work of Nature
as well as of man, are beautiful. This long,
subtly-curved boat, with its uptossed stem
and stern, rigid in reality, but seeming to
be (so swift it is to answer the slightest
touch of the oar) as lithe and undulating as
a serpent, leaning somewhat to one side, so
that it wavers a little as it moves as if it
were a wave of the sea, and gliding on its
flattened bottom over shallow waters in
silent speed, seems like some creature of
the sea herself. Coloured black, it is brightened
with polished brass and steel. The
<i>ferro da prova</i> is the beak of polished steel
which looks out from the bows of the boat,
with a blade at the top like a hatchet, and
below it six teeth, like those of the bone of
the saw-fish. It flashes over the water and
flashes in the water. It is a sea-ornament,
descended from the rostrum of a Roman
warship. Then the brass ornaments of the
arm-rests are most frequently sea-beasts—dolphins,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>and the sea-horses of Venice.
Everywhere the boat has been the child of
the sea.</p>

<p>Yet it is human; it grew like a child, a
youth, modified from year to year into its
shape, its character, till it reached its manhood;
absolutely fitted for the work it had
to do, for the circumstances of the city
through the narrow water-ways of which it
had to move, and for the wants of all classes
of its citizens. The circumstances were
peculiar; the needs of the citizens were
most various. It fits them all. The natural,
therefore, and the human mingle in it more
harmoniously than in any other boat. It
is distinctive as Venice is distinctive; it has
its own sentiment, its own charm; but it
seems also to share in the sentiment and
beauty of the sea. The cries of its rowers
are like the cries of seamen. In its movement
is the softness, ease, and grace of
the subdued obedient waters over which it
glides.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>
<p>Then there is the way of rowing it, on one
side, by a single rower. When there are two
rowers half the charm is lost. The second
rower labouring at his oar in front of the
sitter removes the pleasant, psychical illusion
that the boat moves by its own will.
There is almost an intellectual pleasure in
the rowing and steering of a gondola by
the single oar behind. If the gondolier be
a master of his craft, he will make his boat
move through a crowded canal, or glide
round the angles of a narrow water lane, as
swiftly, as softly as a serpent through the
branches of a tree. He will pass within an
inch of a corner without touching it, as he
turns the boat round within its own length.
He will stop it at full speed in a few seconds.
It obeys him so magically that the voyager
in it, who does not see the rower, often
dreams that the boat moves of itself according
to a spirit in it, like the bark which bore
Ogier the Dane, flying over the sea by its
own desire, to Morgana. This beauty of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>boat, its ways and manners, are the result
of the sea-situation, and have the charm of
the sea.</p>

<p>Then, again, this strange, soft sea, so
tempered into gentlehood, brings through
its quietude another element of charm into
Venice. It reflects all things with a wonderful
perfection. Whatever loveliness is by its
side it makes more lovely. Shallow itself,
it seems deep; and the towers and palaces
of Venice in all their colours descend and
shine among other clouds and in another sky
below. All outlines of sculpture and architecture,
of embossment, in wall and window;
all play of sunshine and shade; all the
human life in balcony, bridge or quay, on
barge or boat, are in the waters as in a
silent dream—revealed in every line and
colour, but with an exquisite difference in
softness and purity. All Nature’s doings in
the sky are also repeated with a tender fidelity
in the mirror of the lagoon—morning light,
noonday silver, purple thunder cloud in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>afternoon, sunset vapours, the moon and
stars of night—and not only on the surface,
but also, it seems, in an immeasurable
depth. To look over the side of the
boat into the water is to cry, “I see infinite
space.”</p>

<p>That is part of this charm of the reflecting
water. But this only belongs to Nature
and the feeling her beauty awakens. There
is another charm in this work of the water.
Whatever pleasure the living and varied
movement of a great town, whatever interest
its activities, bring to men, is doubled, so
far as charm is concerned, in Venice. For
they are exercised on water as well as on
land, and their movements and methods
are different on each. The sights of life are
doubly varied. The land has its own way
with them; the water has another way with
them.</p>

<p>Moreover, the water itself, being always
in motion, always reflecting or taking
shadows, always harmonizing itself with its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>comrades in land or sky, always making a
subtle music in answer to human action
upon it—adds these romantic and lovely
elements to the business and pleasure of
the town. Below, in the water, the clumsiest
barge is accompanied by its soft ideal; and
the lovers, leaning over the balcony, see
their happiness smile on them from the
water.</p>

<p>The same thing, some aver, may be said
of a Dutch town full of canals. Partly, that
is true; but the canals only carry the heavy
business of these towns, and in Venice all
human life, in its gaiety and beauty as well
as its work, is on the water. Moreover, the
water itself, not half stagnant like the canals
of Holland, is always thrilling with its own
ebbing and flowing, has its own fine spirit,
and takes, as I have often thought, its own
share and pleasure in all that is done upon
it. Life answers there to life—living Nature
to living man.</p>

<p>Not apart from this element of charm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>are other forms of it. The mystery and
music of moving water, the sense of unknown
depths and its wonder, the impression
of the infinite which gathers into us
from the sea, are all brought by the tides
in Venice into the midst of a bustling city,
vividly concerned with the material, the
finite, and the practical. We feel the wonder
and secret of Nature playing round our
business. In a moment we are touched
into imaginative worlds. We may pass with
ease from buying and selling into poetry,
from materialism into mystery. This has
its surprising charm.</p>

<p>The element of noiselessness increases
this impression of poetic mystery. The
Venetians themselves make noise enough.
They are a gay and passionate people on
the surface, and their open-air life makes
them open in speech. The air is full of
shouting, but the rattle and shattering and
trampling of wheels and horses over stony
roads which wears out life so rapidly in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>towns on land, is never heard in Venice.
And there are numberless lanes of quiet
water where the crowd of gondolas never
comes, and where the only sound is the wash
of water on the stones and the murmur of the
acacias above our head. The quiet sea has
stolen into the streets, and all that is beautiful
in their architecture, their history, and
their daily life, creeps into the study of our
imagination with more impressive grace
because of the peace. As to the quiet of
the lagoon it is like the solemn quiet of
the desert. In ten minutes from the quay
we are in the midst of a silence deeper even
than that of the lonely hills. The silence
listens to itself, and we can scarcely believe
in the turmoil of the world or the battle
in our own heart. This has its healing
charm.</p>

<p>Then, also, the nearness and universal
presence of the waters makes man more
alive to the beauty of the few things which
belong to the land in Venice. There are no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>woods, no parks, no great gardens, no wealth
of foliage or grass, but what there is of
flowers and trees and grassy spaces is more
lovingly observed than on the land. The
great fig trees which drop their broad foliage
over the walls, the little groves of soft
acacia which stand beside some of the
churches, the tiny plots of green verdure in
the squares, the tall oleanders ablaze with
white and ruddy flowers, the climbing vines
that twine amongst the carved stone work,
the rare small gardens with their black
cypresses, white lilies, golden fruit; the
one stone pine dark against the sky, the
scarlet flash of the pomegranate, the tumbled
wealth of a single rose tree, might all
be thought little of in an Italian town.
They are common there and multitudinous.
But here, at Venice, in the midst of the
waters they are strange; they surprise and
enchant. They are always observed; all
their beauty is felt.</p>

<p>Amid all this water-world, and the human
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>life which uses it and loves it, there is one
place where it is fairest and most used by
man. It is the great expanse of water at the
entrance of the Grand Canal, opposite the
Ducal Palace, in whose surface is reflected
the Campanile of San Giorgio Maggiore on
its island, the dome of the Church of Our
Lady of Safety, and the tower of the
Dogana. From the Dogana runs out to the
south the broad canal which divides Venice
from the islands of the Giudecca. In the
opposite direction the glittering surface
spreads away to the port of the Lido, where
between the Lido and San Andrea the
lagoon opens into the main sea. On these
waters, in the past and present, have collected,
and still collect, the ships and barks
that have carried on the wars, the commerce,
and the fishing life of Venice.</p>

<p>I do not describe the scene, but the
glancing, dazzling water, the blue expanse,
seem as if they had been designed by Nature
to harmonize with the swiftness and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>dash of the warlike spirit and warwork of
ancient Venice, with the splendour of her
commerce and the merchandise it brought,
with the magnificence of her religion and
the dignity of her government, whose noblest
observances and pageants were displayed
on these shining waters.</p>

<p>It is one of the enchantments of Venice
that it is so easy for imaginative knowledge,
impelled and kindled to its work by this
glistening and splendid water-world, to recreate
upon it the vivid life of the past; to
see the long war-galleys pass out into the
Adriatic, beating the water into foam; to
watch the ships from all the Orient disembark
their costly goods and men from the
tribes of the East on the quays; to picture
the many hued and stately processions from
the sea to the palace of the Duke, from San
Marco to the sea. A splendid vision! A
little reading, some careful study of the
pictures in the Accademia, and the voyager
can crowd, as he stands on the Piazzetta,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>that gleaming mirror of sea with a hundred
scenes of glory, beauty, use and charm in
war and peace.</p>

<p>Little now remains of that wonderful sea-glory,
and the beauty of its ships is departed.
Some merchant boats lie stern to
stern along the quays of the Giudecca, black
and built like boxes. Steamboats carrying
heavy goods, now and then a great liner,
scream and hiss in the lagoon. The war-galleys
of Venice are replaced by ironclads.
All the outward romance of this great sheet
of water is gone. It cannot be helped, and
we must put our regret by, lest we should
spoil or under-rate the present; but some
reverence, some care might be given to the
memory of the glorious past, and this scene
at least might have been saved from desecration.
It was possible a few years ago for
imagination still to create the glory of the
past upon these waters; it was only the
steamers that forced us to remember the
present, and when they did not scream they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>were not offensive. But not long ago, and
right between the Lido and the public
gardens, blocking the most beautiful view
of Venice from the Lido, an iron foundry,
with tall chimneys outpouring black smoke,
was established on the Island of Santa
Elena. I have already referred to this contemptuous
destruction of loveliness. It is
a miserable comfort that the foundry has
failed. But the mischief done is irreparable.</p>

<p>One part, however, of that past is still
existing on Venetian waters. The fishing
boats—the Bragozzi—are much the same
as they were in the days when the city held
“the East in fee and was the safeguard of
the West.” They carry us back even to remoter
times when only a few huts had been
built on the sandbanks, and the dwellers in
the little group of islands lived by fishing.
They have been comrades of the whole
history of Venice.</p>

<p>These barks are still beautiful, and make
more beautiful the waters on which they sail.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>Their bow still keeps that noble, subtle, and
audacious curve which every artist loves.
It is painted on either side with various
designs fitted to carry the eye forward with
the rush of the boat through the waters—angels
blowing trumpets, the virgin leaning
forward in impassioned listening—and these,
in many colours, glimmer from far on the
sight, and are often seen shining in the
wave below. On the dark sails, of which
there are two, the sun, the stars, angel
heads, St. George and the Dragon, St.
Anthony, the Virgin in glory, symbolic designs,
a radiant sun, geometrical patterns,
are painted in orange, blue and pale sea-green
on the dark body of the sail, which
is generally of deep red. The orange is
most often introduced in bands or patterns
among the red: and when the fishermen take
pleasure in their coloured patterns, the blue,
green, and white are added to the orange.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful sight to see these fishing
barks drawn up along the great quay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>from the public gardens to the Ducal Palace,
with all their sails hoisted after a stormy
day, to dry in the gay sunlight. From end
to end the long line burns with the colours
of which the Venetian painters were so
enamoured. It is as delightful to stand on
the sea-wall on the Lido, near the Church of
San Nicolo di Bari, where the lagoon opens
into the Adriatic, and watch these barks
coming in from the sea, one by one; glowing
in the lovely light, changing the waters below
into orange, red, and black, edged with
gold. Sometimes, grouped into a mass, they
cluster together in the deep places of the
canals, or lie in a changing crowd together
near the mouth of the Piave, nets, mast and
sails one glow of shifting colour. Sometimes,
when fine weather comes after the
storm which has driven home the whole
fleet, they all go out together, and the whole
lagoon seems full of their glory, as pushing
through the water-lanes, they cross one
another and interweave a dance of colour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>and of freedom. Sometimes, as the sun
sets, one of them, anchored alone, takes
into the hollow of its sail the whole blaze
of the globe of fire as it sinks over the
Euganean hills.</p>

<p>These pictures are taken out of the realm
of mere artistic pleasure by thoughts of the
hard labour and the rough struggle of the
fishers’ toil for wife and children as they sail
on stormy Adria. Indeed, they are as full of
humanity as of beauty. They have also the
charm of historical sentiment. The first
fugitives to Rialto saw these barks much as
we see them. The builders of the city, its
early merchants and warriors, its voyagers
and artists, the Dukes that fought the son
of Charles the Great, or harried the nests
of the Dalmatian pirates, or subdued the
Orient; the ambassadors who sued or defied
the Senate, visitors from every quarter of
the globe, the luxurious wretches who degraded,
and the cowardly crew who sold
Venice; the patriots who defended her;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>those who mourned under the yoke of
Austria, those who rejoiced in the great
deliverance—one and all have looked with
many a thought that charmed their heart
upon the fishing boats of Venice. With them
Venice began; by them she has been fed
from the beginning even until now. They
are a vital part of her sea charm.</p>

<p>The live lagoon itself is of endless interest.
It has quite a little population of its own.
Boys and men, clothed only in a loose shirt,
and with the glowing skin the sun and sea
create, move to and fro over the shallow
spaces fishing for sea-spoil, sometimes white
against the purple arch of the stormy sky,
sometimes like a pillar of rose in the setting
sun; and their slow, unremitting labour,
which means for them no more than an
escape from starvation, makes one ashamed
to think so much of beauty, unless we bind
it up with the trouble of the world.</p>

<p>A livelier, more comfortable population
is that of the birds. I have only seen gulls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>in the lagoon, but they fly, in great delight
and with less talk than in the north, about
the cluster of islands near Torcello, and feed
in flocks over the shallows when the tide
leaves the sea-grasses bare; animating, enlivening
the desolate shores, and gossiping
so gaily that for the moment of our notice
of them, it is hard to believe that a thousand
years of the rise, the glory and the decay
of a great people have been represented on
the waters and the islands they make their
pasture and their playground.</p>

<p>The islands in the lagoon are full of
charm. I do not speak of Torcello or
Burano, the first of which is famous in the
pages of Ruskin, and the other inhabited by
a crowd of fisher-folk and lace-makers; or
of those closely knit to Venice itself, such
as Murano, San Giorgio, or those of the
Giudecca; nor even of San Michele, where
the dead of Venice lie washing in the water;
though it was once a place I visited every
week when the small blue butterfly was born.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>The old wall was still there and its decayed
brickwork, and I used to fancy that the souls
of the dead were in the azure insects that
never ceased to flit in whirling, silent flight
among the wild grass and over the tombstones
of that solitary place—souls so small,
so courteous to one another, so beautiful in
colour and in movement that I thought the
charm of the sea had entered into their
nature, that they desired to charm, but
were unconscious of their charm.</p>

<p>Among the islands, though perhaps it
cannot justly be called an island, <i>The
Lido</i> claims the greater interest. It extends,
right opposite to Venice, for five
miles—a long low ridge of heaped-up sand,
a quarter of a mile broad—from San Nicolo
to Malamocco. It is the chief guard of Venice
from the Adriatic. At each end is a passage
to the open sea whose dark blue waves break
on the white, brown, and yellow sand of its
sea-ward side; on the other, the ripples of
the lagoon lap the low wall which looks out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>on Venice across the quiet water. At the
northern end stands the Church of San
Nicolo di Bari, one of the patron Saints of
the city; in its apse the Venetians lodged
the bones of the saint they had stolen with
all the cleverness of Ulysses. His spirit
watched for their welfare and defended the
great port of their town. At a short distance
from the Church we come to the very point
of the Lido. Opposite is the Fort of San
Andrea and the long island of San Erasmo,
the first of a succession of Lidi curving inwards
like a bow to the mainland near the
mouth of the Piave, and sheltering Torcello,
Burano and other islands in the northern
lagoon. In days gone by, this succession of
low-lying shores was clothed with pines—as
the coral islands of the Pacific are
with palms—a dark, green, narrow, flower-haunted
wood, which, rising as it were out
of the breast of the sea, must have charmed
the mind with a hundred fantasies. Not a
tree of it is left, though the soil is rich and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>fertile. Between San Erasmo and the Lido
the deep sea-channel opens out to Adria—an
historic strait of waters—through
which a thousand thousand ships have gone
out for war and trade and pleasure in all
the splendour of the past, and returned with
music, victory and treasure. It was through
this opening that the Doge, attended by
all the warriors, ecclesiastics, counsellors,
statesmen and great merchants of Venice,
in his gorgeous galley, moved by some
hundred oars, and surrounded by all the
boats of Venice, with music, and shouting
and triumph, went forth to wed the sea, and
dropped along with holy-water his ring over
the stern with equal humility and pride. It
was here that on a night of furious storm
the three great saints who cared for the
safety of the Republic, St. Mark, St. George,
and St. Nicolas, delivered Venice from the
demon-ship which was bringing from the sea
pestilence and destruction on the faithful
city. Everyone knows the legend, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>noble picture in the Accademia tells the
story of how the fisherman—whose boat
St. Mark had hired to take him at dead of
night through a roaring gale to San Giorgio
Maggiore and then to San Nicolo—brought
to the Doge in the morning the ring
St. Mark, before he embarked on this expedition,
had taken from the treasury of his
Church. “Give that,” he said, as returning,
he landed on the Piazzetta, “to the
Doge, and bid him send it back to my
Church.” And the Doge, knowing the ring,
believed the story of the night. Nor is this
the only record in art of the legend. There
is an unfinished picture attributed to
Giorgione of the three Saints in their fishing
boat meeting at the mouth of the Lido
the ship of hell, and repelling it with the
Cross. The sea is tossed into violent surges,
huge masses edged with fiery foam, over
which the deep-bellied purple clouds are
driven by the tempest. The demons man
the racing ship that seems to shiver as it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>is suddenly stayed in the very entrance of
the port. Clouds and sea in raging storm,
lit by the flashing of the lightning in the
collied night, are represented in so modern
a manner, and with so modern a feeling for
nature, that it seems as if Turner’s spirit
had entered into the pencil of Giorgione.</p>

<p>So wild a sea is rarely seen breaking
on the Lido. On the whole, the long low
shore, save when the Scirocco drives the
sand in a river through the air, is peaceful
enough; and there are few chords of colour
stranger or more strangely attractive than
the dark sapphire sea leaping in joy and
with the sound of trampling horses on the
pale yellow belt of sand fringed with the
green meadows, with acacia, maize, and fig
trees, with the pale leaves of the Canne,
and with the low plants, sea-holly, dry
reeds, and thistles which grow on the edge
of the sand where the last breath of the
foam-drift plays upon them—blue, yellow,
and various green, mingling together, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>so it often seemed to me, into a mystic
harmony.</p>

<p>The meadows near San Nicolo, dotted
with low acacia shrub, are lovely—a place
of beloved repose and beauty. Between them
and the landing stage at Sant’ Elisabetta
was once the rude neglected Jewish Cemetery.
The grave-stones are all collected
now and placed within an ugly walled-space
with a small chapel, and an iron-railed
gate. No history, no sentiment can
collect round this hideous enclosure. It was
but right and reverent to redeem the tombstones
from careless neglect; but it might
have been done with some feeling for beauty.
When first I knew Venice, the grave-stones
lay entangled and overgrown with tall lush
grasses, dwarf acacias white with blossom,
and wild-flowers. In spring the daffodils
were gay and golden there; in summer the
wild rose threw its trailers and its starry
flowers over their desolation. Some stones
stood erect, others had fallen. The flat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>stones lay at every angle; and on all of
them long inscriptions in Hebrew recorded
the love and honour paid to the departed
by the persecuted race, who were forced to
lay their dead on this wild and uninhabited
shore. The place was full of history. It
symbolised the unhappy fortunes of the
race in the days of enmity and persecution.
Here Shylock and Tubal, I thought, were
housed at last. Here rested many a Jew,
whose life was as noble as that of Shylock
was base. The flowers had taken care of
them, and woven over them a web of beauty.
Nature had repaired the cruelty and intolerance
of man. I should have bought the
whole ground and surrounded it with a low
wall, had I been a Jew; and tended the
flowers, and left the place to itself. The
birds and the insects loved it. It was as
pathetic as it was beautiful.</p>

<p>Beyond it is the Church of St. Elizabeth
where the bathers land. Five minutes’
walk takes one across from the lagoon to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>the seashore, bordered by hillocks of shifting
sand “matted with thistles and amphibious
weeds,” and itself close to the
blue incoming of the waves, luminous with
shells, and hard enough to ride on with a
great pleasure, such pleasure as Byron and
Shelley had day by day</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">for the winds drove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The living spray along the sunny air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into our faces; the blue heavens were bare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stripped to their depths by the awakening north;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, from the waves, sound like delight broke forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Harmonising with solitude, and sent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into our hearts aereal merriment.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, as we rode, we talked.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So Shelley wrote, and then described how
he crossed the Lido to the lagoon and looked
on the sunset. And to this day there are
few changes more impressive than when
the traveller leaves the seashore, with the
freshness of the waves and the solitude of
the sea-beach in his heart, and, crossing
to the other side, looks forth on the still
slumber of the lagoon, and on the towers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>and peopled houses of the white and golden
city, such a city—at the evening hour when
all the sky behind is in a glory of crimson,
pearl, and azure—as Galahad beheld when
from the lofty cliff above the Ocean, he
rode across the waves to be received at the
glimmering gates with trumpets sounding,
with songs and welcome by the angelic and
the saintly host.</p>

<p>The Lido has its interest, but the greater
charm belongs to the remoter islands, each
alone in the waste of water, and with attractive
names. It is their habit on slumbrous
days to float in air and not on the
water. A silver line of sunny mist stretches
right across the base of the island, and
on this it rests, as if it wished to join the
sky. This sportive ethereality is one of
the wanton wiles with which they bewilder
the voyager’s imagination. Their names
are romantic. San Lazzaro, Santa Elena,
San Giacomo del Palude, San Francesco
del Deserto, Il Spirito, La Grazia, San
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>Giorgio in Alga. Each had its monastic
church in ancient days, and from every
part of the lagoon the bells then sweetly
rang over the receptive water at morning,
noon, and evening. Of all these monasteries
only two remain, San Francesco del
Deserto and San Lazzaro. Only in these
is the Church still served, the cloister and
the cells still intact, the garden still cultivated,
the cypress and poplar garth still
a place of musing; and only at San
Francesco, by the corner of the isle that
looks to Venice, is there one stone pine, a
Tuscan stranger in the alien north. The
rest of the small islands and their churches
are desecrated, used for state and municipal
purposes, with the exception of Torcello and
Burano.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no more beautiful row
in Venice than, as the sunset begins in
September days, to take the gondola out
of the mouth of the Giudecca and make
our winding way to St. George of the Seaweed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>set lovely in the lonely waters that
look towards the Euganean Hills. Around
it lie the shallower sea-marshes near the
mainland, and when the gold of the sunset
strikes them, they flame like emerald
beds of fire. The tower of the island church
used to rise, thin and black, with two
upper windows through which the sun
poured two shafts of light, against the
south-western glow—a beacon seen far and
wide, a memorial tower that in its silence
held a thousand thoughts. It is now destroyed.
It was not in the way; it might
have been kept for the sake of beauty by
a few clamps; but this was too much for
modern Venice. I resented its departure
bitterly. One consolation remained. When
the boat drew near the angle of the island,
there stood, and still stands, set high on the
angle of the wall, an image of the Virgin,
rudely carved, but with grave simplicity and
faith. She held her son in her arms. On
her head was an iron crown, engrailed, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>over her head an iron umbrella with a fringe
of beaten iron. She looked towards Venice
with blessing and protection, and claimed
her right in Venice. She was a Virgin for
the people and of the people, a gentle,
lowly born, working woman, with a face of
sorrow and strength, such as we may see
every day in the small squares of Venice
when the people gather round the well. And
yet there was such nobility, love, motherhood,
and so much sweet spirit in her air,
so much of watching to protect and guard
the sea and its fisher-folk, that I cried
when I saw her first, and afterwards in my
soul when I passed her, Ave Maria, Maris
Stella!</p>

<p>There is somewhere another Virgin on
another island, with also her lamp at night
and her canopy, but I forget where she
stands. Wherever she is, she is the same
benign and lonely person, the Madonna Protectrix
of the sailor and the lagoon.</p>

<p>The row home from this island as the sun
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>descends to its rest on autumn evenings, is
of an extraordinary splendour and beauty.
The little wavelets of the lagoon are ebony
in shade and blazing gold on the side where
the light falls. The sea-banks turn a golden
brown, and their grasses seem to change
into the warm green of the deep sea. The
sky drops from liquid and pellucid blue to
pearl, and then to orange, crimson and
gold. The wild lights fall on the city which
grows slowly on the eyes, and every tower
is a tower of fire. And behind, beyond St.
George of the Seaweed, but towards the left,
are the triangled Euganean Hills, down the
sides of the greatest of which I have often
seen the sun roll like a wheel, such a wheel
as Ezekiel saw in vision. Shelley saw them
at this sunset hour.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Those famous Euganean hills, which bear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As seen from Lido thro’ the harbour piles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The likeness of a clump of peakèd isles—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then—as if the Earth and Sea had been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dissolved into one lake of fire, were seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those mountains towering as from waves of flame</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>
    <div class="verse indent0">Around the vaporous sun, from which there came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The inmost purple spirit of light, and made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their very peaks transparent.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again and again I have seen this apparent
transparency of the peaks. That Shelley recorded
it is one example of how closely he
observed nature, and how accurately he
recorded her doings. Much more might be
said of the islands; but this seems enough.
Each of them, right away to the Piave on
one side and to Chioggia on the other, has
its history, its religion, and its ruin.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the greatest pleasures of
the lagoon is sailing on it. A gondola is
scarcely a safe boat to sail, except in a
following wind. It has no keel, and it turns
over easily, but with one of the great oars
behind it steers steadily. Once, with two
rowers, I took more than two hours to row
from Venice to Torcello against the wind.
I sailed back in forty minutes. The lagoon
was rough with short tossing waves edged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>with foam, indescribably fresh and gay.
The long boat, with its flat bottom, flew
over the surface of four or five waves together,
at a torrent speed. I never was so
conscious of swiftness, and the boat itself
was alive beneath, all its will in its movement,
pulling and leaping like an Arab
steed. This was delightful; nor is it less
delightful, having made friends with the
owners of one of the larger boats, to sail
up and down the sea-streets of the lagoon,
when the wind is fresh and the tide
running fast, and the night is dark, save
for glimpses of the hurrying moon. The
steersman is silent, the sky is silent, the
soul itself is silent. Nothing speaks but
the wind in the sail and the water round
the rushing prow, and these sounds deepen
the silence. That which men feel who stand
sentinel on the bow of a ship in the midst
of the great Oceans, one may feel here close
to a busy town. And in the vast solitude
and peace the infinite Spirit of Nature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>comes home to our spirit, and we feel our
own infinity.</p>

<p>But quiet is not always the seal of the
lagoon. I have seen it tormented and torn
with wind, so ravaged that it was impossible
to cross from the Piazzetta to San Giorgio
Maggiore, so furious that the waves leaped
up the quay and ran along the pavement to
the space between the orient pillars whence
St. Theodore and the Lion of St. Mark
watch over the heart of Venice. Nor can I
refrain from telling here what once I saw of
deadly storm out on the lagoon close by the
island of St. James of the Marsh. We had
been rowing back from Torcello under a
terrible sky, very lofty, of dark purple cloud,
smooth as the inside of a cup. Across this,
in incessant play, the lightning fled to and
fro, not in single flashes, but in multitudes
at the same time, ribbons and curling
streamers and branching trees of white
violet and crimson light. So far away and
high they were that the thunder of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>movement sent no sound to us. Towards
the Alps a white arch seemed to open under
the pall of cloud, and in it were whirlings
of vapour. The gondolier bent forward and
said—We must take refuge. We must land
at the island. I laughed, and said—No, we
will go on; and I heard him mutter to himself—These
English have no fear. And then
I thought that he was certain to know far
more than I of the lagoon, and I turned
and said: “It is not courage we have, but
ignorance; do what you think right”; and
we drew the boat to the landing of
San Giacomo, and crossed the little island
to the rampart that looked forth to the
mainland; and then, issuing out of the white
wrath that seemed to dwell in the cloud-arch,
a palm tree of pale vapour formed
itself and came with speed. It reached
the lagoon near Mestre, and towered out of
it to the heaven, its ghostly pillar relieved
against the violet darkness of the sky, its
edge as clear as if cut down by a knife, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>about a yard apparently in breadth. It came
rushing across the lagoon, driven by the
Spirit of wind which within whirled and
coiled its column into an endless spiral.
The wind was only in it; at its very edge
there was not a ripple; but as it drew near
our island it seemed to be pressed down on
the sea, and, unable to resist the pressure,
opened out like a fan in a foam of vapour.
Then, with a shriek which made every
nerve thrill with excitement, the imprisoned
wind leaped forth, the sea beneath it boiled,
and the island, as the cloud of spray and
wind smote it, trembled like a ship struck
by a great wave. Then the whirlwind fled
on to Burano and smote the town. Next
morning a number of persons were brought
into the Hospital at Venice who had been
wounded by the whirl-storm. There is wild
weather in Venice and on its waters.</p>

<p>I have known Venice so dark under black
wind and rain that it was impossible to read
at three in the afternoon in August. I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>stood on the Rialto in so heavy a snowstorm
that not a single boat crossed the
empty, desolate river of the Grand Canal.
The palaces were clear in the cold light,
their marbles shining in the wet. The tiled
roofs were white with snow, and the dark
ranges of gondolas moored to the quays
were relieved by the snow that lay thickly
upon them. The Campaniles rose out of
the mist with a touch of snow on their
windward side. A gloomier sight, a more
unhappy day I never saw. Yet even in this
wild weather Venice wore her beauty like
a robe and exercised her incessant fascination.
I have walked over the Piazza,
crunching through the ice that covered its
inundated marbles. I have sheltered from
the furious rain and wind of a roaring
Scirocco under the door of the Hospital in
the Square of SS. John and Paul, and seen
through the driving slant of rain Colleone
proudly reining in his horse, his bâton in
his hand, his noble casque outlined like a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>falcon, and his eager and adventurous face
in profile against the dun sky. He looked
as he may have looked many a time, leading
his men, when wild weather was roving
over Lombardy.</p>

<p>I have felt as if the very waters trembled,
like the palaces, with the appalling roar
and shattering clash of such a thunderstorm
as I have never known elsewhere;
but the most impressive aspect of savage
weather is when, in tremendous rain, one
stands sheltered under the colonnade, at
the corner where the Piazzetta turns into
the Piazza. The enormous roof of St.
Mark’s, and that of the Procuratie, collect
the rain and pour it forth by the great
spouts more than a yard in length which
project over the pavement from the parapets.
From each of these, from hundreds of them,
a cataract leaps like a tigress, and falls
resounding on the pavement. The noise is
deafening, the pavement is half a foot deep
in turbulent water, the wind screams, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>men are blown across the square, the
gondolas rock at the steps and beat against
the piles, the thunder roars till the two
giant columns, where St. Theodore and the
Lion stand in proud serenity, seem to
shake, and through the black sap of rain,
the lightning flares the Ducal Palace into
momentary colour. It is a sight, a sound,
not to be forgotten. Tintoret, with his
sympathy for the wild work of nature, has
seized and recorded this in his picture of
the bearing of the body of St. Mark out
of Alexandria. The Alexandrian Square
he has made into the Piazzetta of Venice.
The rain is falling in torrents, the waterspouts
cascade to the pavement. The pavement
is so deep in the running water that
it is looped around the legs of the bearers
of the body, fiercely swirling. It is a
splendid picture of a Venetian storm, and
in the background of it, that we may not
lose the sea, the waves of the lagoon are
breaking over the quay.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>
<p>But these impressions are endless. In
other towns there is some constancy in
the doings of nature. The general aspect of
the weather is much the same for a month
at a time. In Venice not a day passes
without many changes. The various and
mutable sea-goddess has her own wild and
fickle way with her peculiar people.</p>

<p>Once more, before I leave the lagoon and
the islands, I will record a day I spent,
when partly by gondola and partly walking,
I made the circuit of Venice in pursuit of
her sea-charm. Early in the morning I left
the Piazzetta and rowed down the Riva dei
Schiavoni till I reached the public gardens.
Their sea-wall dipped from a path shaded
by acacias, thick with white blossom in the
spring, into the lagoon, and at the point of
the peninsula the gardens make, I looked
south along the quay into the very mouth
of the Grand Canal, with the Palace and
the Campanile on one side, and the Church
of the Salute and of St. Giorgio on the other,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>a glorious group of buildings which seemed
to borrow splendour and delight in their
own existence from the dancing, sparkling,
rippling, glancing, laughing water which
surrounded them. It was like an Empire’s
gate, and the Empire was the Empire of
the Sea. Right opposite, between me and
the Lido, lay the Island of Sant’ Elena, like
a jewel of emerald and pearl set in the blue
enamel of the sea. Its little church was
nestled in trees, and over its sea-wall hung
dark green and tangled boughs of ilex, and
pale acacia, and the golden wealth of fig
trees; and all along the parapet roses
trailed and the gadding vine, and scented
the sweet soft wind. I little thought that,
as I write now, there would not be left one
trace of all this beauty. I rowed out to it
there and landed. The church was used as
a granary, but beside it the tiny cloister was
still exquisite even in its ruin—paved with
marble and brick; its small Gothic arches
and the roofs of its remaining rooms garmented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>and entangled with roses. A carved
well stood in the centre, and all around the
low wall of the arcades, every leaf and flower
gleaming in the sunlight, tall oleanders,
pink and white, grew in deep red pots of
clay—a place so fair, so sweet and solitary,
so noiseless save for the bees, that the
delicate soul of St. Francis, whose was the
church, would have prayed in it with joy,
and praised the Lord who made the world
so lovely.</p>

<p>Then I rowed round the wall of the
Arsenal to San Pietro di Castello. Behind
that church and the Arsenal is the
most wretched part of Venice, where the
people are poorest and wildest, and the
lanes most unkempt and uncared for. Yet
it was here, on this outlying island, that
for many centuries the Cathedral of Venice
claimed the reverence of the city. The old
church has long perished, and its unhappy
successor stands now in a deserted square
with plots of dry and melancholy grass
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>where the fishermen dry their nets, nor has
it any dignity or beauty of its own. But I
loved the place for its loneliness, and for
its wide view across the shining lagoon
to the misty plain of the mainland, and
beyond to the “eagle-baffling” rampart of
the Alps. That wide-expanding view is no
longer visible, for the Arsenal has been extended,
and shut out its glory. The square
is now quite desolate, but it is still worth
visiting for its associations. Here every
year the Brides of Venice were dowered by
the State; here their ravishment by the
pirates took place. It was Magnus, Bishop
of Altinum, that set up here the first Church
of Venice, the same Magnus to whom the
Lord appeared in vision and told him to
build a Church (St. Salvador) in the midst
of the city on a plot of ground above which
he should see a red cloud rest. A different
vision built San Pietro. St. Peter himself
appeared to Magnus and commanded him
to set up a Church in his name, where he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>should find on Rivo Alto oxen and sheep
feeding on the meadows. The grass of the
Campo still recalls the ancient legend.</p>

<p>Even now, as I write, I see the Tower and
the paved square, and the gardens behind,
and recall a favourite picture in the church
which, amid the desolation of the island,
is like a lovely maid in a deserted wood.
It is said to be by Basaiti, and pictures
St. George and the Dragon. It is arched at
the top, and the arch is filled with a pale
evening sky of rosy light, soft as a dream,
and faintly barred with lines of vaporous
blue. Into this tender sky rises on the left
a mountain, broad and alone, and below the
mountain a ranging hill, and below the hill
the walls, towers and gates of a city, and
below the city a two-arched bridge, and
below the bridge a flowing river, and on the
bank of the river St. George on his horse,
his head bent down to his horse’s neck with
the couching of his spear, and on the spear
the formless dragon, and above the dragon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>on the right, Sabra, clinging in lingering
flight to the trunk of a great fig tree that
flings into the rosy sky three long branches
sparsely clothed with leaves. They hang, as
if to crown the victor, over the head of
St. George, whose face, young, yet full of
veteran experience and holiness, is of the
same grave tenderness as the sky. This is
Basaiti in his noblest vein and manner,
and the picture has on the whole escaped
the restorers.</p>

<p>I left the square, with this noble painting
in my mind, and rowed on to the Sacca della
Misericordia beyond the Canal, which leads
to the Church of SS. John and Paul. This
is a great square piece of the lagoon, surrounded
on three sides by sheds and houses,
where all the wood used for building in Venice
is brought from the mainland, and left floating
on the water. The place has always
fascinated me, I scarcely know why—for
the view of San Michele and Murano and
the Alps beyond is seen as well from other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>points—but I think it partly is that the
great trunks and beams, and the sawn
planks seasoning in the water, bring back
to me the mountain valleys, torrents and
knolls of rock where the trees were hewn
down, and fill the sea-city with images of
the wild landscape of the land; and partly
that one seems to see in the waiting wood
all that human hands will make of it—houses,
roofs, furniture, bridges, gondolas,
barks that will meet the beating of the
Adriatic waves, piles that will build foundations
for new buildings. The coming human
activity moves like a spirit over the floating
masses in this tract of water.</p>

<p>Then I rowed on till, crossing the southern
entrance of the Grand Canal, I touched on
the low wall of the little grassy campo in
front of the Church of San Andrea. It
looked over the lagoon, the water of which
lapped its sea-wall, to the mainland. Opposite
it was the Island of San Giorgio in
Aliga, its dark tower black against the pale
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>pearl and rose of the late afternoon sky;
on its left, seeming to lie on the water,
the violet range of the volcanic Euganeans,
so far, so delicate, so ethereal, that they
appeared to be made of the evening sky.
The rest of the heaven was cloudy, but the
sweetness of solitude, and the peace of this
deserted place, and the spirit of the coming
evening, were so full of grace that I landed,
dismissed my gondola, and stood under the
porch of the late Gothic church, enjoying
the silence. There is a carving over the
door, so simple and childlike in feeling that
it is hard to believe it is Renaissance work.
It is of St. Peter walking on the water and
of St. Andrew close at hand in his boat,
with a gondolier’s oar floating in the water,
and beyond a piece of broken landscape.
This little invention into which the sculptor
had put his soul suited the quiet square, not
larger than a large room. Thought and
imagination seemed to be limited by the
narrow space, but only seemed, for in front
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>opened out to the south the broad lagoon and
the wide plain of the mainland, and I knew
that to the north rose into an infinite sky
the peaks of the Alps, aspiring to reach the
celestial City. I lingered long, hoping that
the clouds would clear away, but it was not
then I had that revelation. Afterwards, when
walking somewhere near San Sebastiano,
I came to a small bridge and there I beheld
what seemed to be the gates of Paradise.
The clouds had lifted to the north and the
south-west. They rolled away like a folding
scroll, and what I saw was the clear light
of the setting sun on one side, and on the
other the whole range of the Julian Alps,
with the rose of the sunset on their freshly
fallen snows. I crossed a muddy canal and
found myself with an unimpeded view on
the grassy and deserted ground of the Campo
Marte. It ran out then into the lagoon,
and I stood on its wild beach looking out
upon the waters. Sea-marsh and lonely
piles and flitting sea birds and a solitary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>fishing boat on the rippling surface, growing
gold and crimson, led my eyes to the black
tower of San Giorgio and to the hills of
Padua, and then to the purple bases of the
Alps rising into tender gray and shadowy
blue; and above, tossed and recessed and
fretted into a thousand traceries, the great
waves of the snow peaks, all suffused with
a divine rose. Slowly the evanescent tenderness
departed, but with ceaseless change of
rose and violet and gray. Only above the
engrailed summits the pale azure was steadfast,
the clear shining after rain. I watched
the sun go down, I listened to the roar of
the Adriatic as it came to me, a low
murmur over the solitary field; I heard
the Ave Maria peal sweetly from all the
bells of Venice, and I thought of the Mother
and the Child who saved the world.
And then I went away, having seen a
vision.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>I visited then a garden and friends I knew
and when night fell rowed home down the
Grand Canal. The moon had risen, and her
light, in a sky now clear save of flying
clouds, was intensely brilliant. The great
sea-river, strangely quiet, almost magical
in its stillness and in the flood of white
luminousness that seemed poured upon it
in streams, shimmered like liquid cornelian,
a milky expanse among ghostly palaces on
either hand. The mighty masses of the
Renaissance palaces which, in losing all
their irritating and confusing ornaments in
the dim and melting moonlight, reveal their
noble and beautiful proportions, supplanted
the smaller palaces of Byzantine and Gothic
form which depend so much for the impression
they make on their lovely ornament
and colour, both of which disappear
in the moonlight. Above me, as I rowed,
the glorious blue of the sky, across which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>darted now and then a shooting star, appeared
to watch over its beloved city. The
moon seemed racing in it, so swift in the
fresh sea-wind was the motion of the white
clouds across her disk. Each as it crossed
took rainbow colours, and threw a mystic
shadow on the world below. Only one
gondola passed me by, a lantern burning
on its prow, and its rower, silent as his
boat, looked like a spirit in the moonlight.
Then the deep shadow of the Rialto hid the
moon, and I found my lodging.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is time now to turn to a different matter—What
was the influence, towards the
power to charm, of this water-life of the
sea on the arts in Venice?</p>

<p>First, architecture was made different by
it from all that it was in other Italian towns.
The commerce and the wars of Venice in
the East caused her nobles and merchant
princes to study the buildings of the East.
Rome did not influence them so much as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>Constantinople, Asia Minor, and the Holy
Land. It was long before the northern
Gothic, chiefly Franciscan, had any power in
Venice, and when it had, it was apart from
the spirit of the city. The Church of St.
Mark is an Eastern not a Western Church.
Many of the palaces along the Grand Canal
were built in imitation of palaces the merchants
had seen when they anchored in
Orient ports. Often, as one wanders in the
narrow streets, a window, a door-head, a
disc in the wall, will remember us of the
Byzantine Empire. There is a disc near
San Polo where the Emperor of Eastern
Rome sits in full imperial robes and crown,
just as Justinian is represented in the mosaic
at San Vitale in Ravenna. At Ravenna, we
are still closer to the architecture of that
Empire, but here, and this is characteristic
of early Venetian architecture, there is a
greater liberty, a more individual choice and
treatment of buildings than there is at Ravenna.
It is scarcely imitation which we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>see, but Eastern ideas of architecture freely
modified and recreated into new forms by
the architects. It is as if the free life of the
sea itself had instilled its wild originality,
variety and beauty into the imagination of
the builders.</p>

<p>The continual change of the sea and its
novelty entered not only into public but
domestic architecture. All along the canals,
the private houses built by the earlier architects
of Venice change incessantly their
form. In every house the ornament is individual.
Moreover, in the work itself, there
is a finish, a delicate delight in perfection
of minute carving, a lavish invention which
belongs to the best Oriental work. Its finish
was always precious; and this ideal of finish
entered also into the first buildings of the
Renaissance in Venice, and made their
sculpture and decoration more lively and
more exquisite than elsewhere in Italy.
This charm in ornament belonged to Venice,
because it was the Queen of the Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>Sea, the mistress of the East. The
Orient brought over the sea the subtlety,
the delicate finish, and the golden beauty of
its art to Venice.</p>

<p>From the East also—and learnt because
Venice was a sea-power—came the extraordinary
love of colour which must have made
mediaeval Venice like a city built of rainbows.
It passed, as I have said, into the
fishing boats and their sails. It belonged to
the poorest houses on the distant islands.
It made the Venetian painters the first
masters of colour. We have some notion
of it from the exterior of St. Mark’s, which
even by moonlight blazes like a breast-plate
of jewels; from its interior, which, subdued
into dark but glowing sanctities of colour,
solemnizes the spirit. But in ancient days
the colour-glory of St. Mark’s was extended
over the whole city. It shone with gold and
crimson, with azure and burning green,
with deep purple and the blue of the sea
waves. The sailors and merchants of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>East when they visited Venice saw in her
architecture colour as brilliant as that of
their own cities, and felt themselves at
home. The architects, lavishing colour
everywhere, made a water street in Venice
as decorative as the title-page of a Missal.</p>

<p>Again, that element of charm arising
from the double life of all things through
reflection in still water, entered, I believe,
into the soul of every architect in Venice,
and modified his work. He knew, or unconsciously
felt as he built, that each palace,
church, tower, and dwelling house would
often have, in unconscious nearness, each its
own image and a second heaven in a mirrored
beauty; that each would be in the
centre of another fair world of its own in the
water beneath it. He was inspired to greater
excellence than in a city on the land, by the
knowledge that all his work, reflected by
the sea, would be seen for ever in a twofold
loveliness.</p>

<p>Two other peculiarities, not found in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>other cities of Italy, give a distinct charm
to the architecture of Venice; and they are
both caused by her position in the sea. The
first of these is that all her important
buildings are covered from cornice to foundation
with precious and lovely marbles.
The foundations were laid with mighty
blocks of Istrian marble, brought from the
mainland; but it was impossible to bring
from so far enough of solid stone to build the
palaces, churches, and dwellings of Venice.
With rare exceptions, then, the walls were
of brick; but, for beauty’s sake, the brick
was overlaid, outside and inside, with thin
slabs of veined and various marbles, with
alabaster, with discs of porphyry, with
mosaic, or with frescoes. The oversheeting
marbles were brought from across the sea.
The frescoes were done by the Venetian
artists. Imagination, flying high, can
scarcely represent to itself the glorious
aspect of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, as
seen from the Rialto, covered from top to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>bottom with frescoes by Titian and Giorgione.
These have perished, but the inlaid
and marble covered walls of the Venetian
palaces remain, and they are like a
lovely mosaic of rich colour. On their
marble and alabaster the sea-winds and
the sunlight have so acted that the surface
has a sheen of flying and evasive colour,
and a patina which I have not seen elsewhere,
even in Genoa. Those accursed restorers
have taken the trouble, notably in
St. Mark’s, of scraping this away. It is like
cleaning the patina away from a Greek
bronze. Nature—sea and sun and wind—had
adopted the buildings for her own, and
given centuries of work to enhance the
beauty of their original colour. Italy has
despised and destroyed this labour of Nature.
But in many places the charm remains,
and it is the work, directly and indirectly,
of the sea.</p>

<p>There is a second thing to say of the influence
of the sea position of Venice on her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>architecture, and of the charm of it. In the
mediaeval towns of the Italian mainland,
the palaces of the nobles and merchants,
even the ordinary houses, present to the
street lofty and blind walls of enormous
strength, especially along the lower story.
They have the aspect of prisons, and they
were made in this fashion for the sake of
defence in the incessant quarrels waged by
the opponent families and parties in the
city. There is no openness, no story of
hospitable receptions, no brightness of life,
no sense of peace, impressed on us by the
great buildings of the inland towns of Italy.
Even when we visit a little hill town like
San Gimignano, we see that the common
houses, as well as those of the nobles, wear
the appearance of fortresses. It is quite
different in Venice. The main entrance of
the houses, of rich and poor, was on the
seaside, on the canal. A wide door, leading
to a long hall, opened by steps on the water.
The glancing of the water plays on the roof
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>of the hall which goes back to a small garden.
The great staircase mounts to the first
story from this hall, and that story has
wide, open-hearted windows with a deep
balcony. Everything suggests peace, fearlessness,
and the welcome of humanity.
The steps seem made for the reception of
crowds of guests. Tall piles, coloured in
bands of red, white, and blue, tell what hosts
of warless gondolas were moored there by
the visitors. The whole of the lower story
was often an arcade. The palace seems to
throw itself open to the air, the light, and
the populace. Its aspect is the aspect of
friendship and hospitality, of a city whose
citizens were at peace one with another.</p>

<p>This makes the appearance of Venice
quite different from that of any other Italian
town, and its charm is great. Nothing
indeed can be prettier or more full of the
delight of changing sunshine and shade, and
of pleasant human life doing its work and
having its joys in the sun, than to row
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>through the narrower canals, and look into
these wide open doors, and see in the glint
and glimmer of the light reflected from the
water the shadowy spaces full of men and
women at work, of boys and girls playing,
of tiny fishermen and tiny bathers making
the bright waters that lap their open doors
their playing and their working place. The
freshness, the breadth, the joyous movement
of the sea, fill their dwelling, regulate
their life, mould their character, and
set the seal of the witchery of the sea on
all they feel and all they do.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This is the charm which the Architecture
of Venice derives from the sea. How far
Venetian Painting was influenced by the
position of Venice on the sea, what charm
it derived from the life of the sea, and how
far the sea was the subject of the artists,
is now the question. It is not easy to
answer it, for the influence of the sea
position was not direct but indirect. It did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>not make the painters of Venice desire to
paint the sea or to care for it as our modern
temper does, but it created, I think, a certain
spiritual or imaginative influence in
their soul, other than that produced by the
landscape of the land, which, it may be
quite unconsciously, entered into their art-work
and had power over it.</p>

<p>The landscape that Cima, Basaiti, Giovanni
Bellini, Catena, loved and painted, that
Giorgione, Bonifazio, and Veronese placed
in the distance of their pictures, was that
of the mainland, of the spurs of the hills as
they dipped into the Lombard plain, of the
lovely network of rock and plain, river and
woodland, of scattered castles and of white
towns on the hilltops, which one sees from
the heights of Verona. On the other hand,
Titian painted the landscape of his native
land, where the torrent comes down through
the massive chestnuts of Cadore; where
the gray limestone peaks leap upwards
thousands of feet, and follow one another,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>like the waves of the sea in the tempest;
and the huge boulders, ablaze with coloured
lichen lie like resting beasts on the short
sweet grass in the green shade of walnut
trees, and the rude farmhouses stand beside
the groves of oak and beech. These were
his delight, but the sea is not in his work
nor in that of his fellows.</p>

<p>What does touch the sea in their pictures
are the skies they painted above this inland
landscape. Their freedom, their diffused
softness, their lofty arch, their bright and
vast expanse, their lucid atmosphere, their
silver subtlety, and their involved and
mighty storm-clouds, are the creation of
the wide and moving sea. Carpaccio and
Catena paint the pale and trembling azure
above the afternoon on the seacoast. Giorgione
has recorded the dark purple thunder-clouds
which climb with eager speed from
the horizon of the sea to threaten the works
of men. Cima of Conegliano paints the
clustered flocks of white cloudlets in a clear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>pale sky which are common in the Venetian
heavens, and which are born of the sea.
Veronese paints the pure, cloudless, deep
blue sky swept clean by the sea-wind, and
under which the sea is radiant. In other
pictures he paints a sky often seen over the
Adriatic. It is indeed a seaside sky—blue
with flat white stratus across the blue, calm,
and trembling with reflections cast up from
the sea. But Titian stands apart. His skies
are of his own mountain valley. The splendours
of the mountain rain, the whirling of
the mountain-clouds belong to him alone.</p>

<p>The “softness and freedom,” so characteristic
of the art of the great Venetian
colourists that the phrase has almost passed
into a proverb, did not belong to the earlier
schools of Venice. These qualities came into
her art with the advent of the New Learning,
which reached Venice even earlier than
it reached Florence, though it was less developed
there than in Florence. As to freedom,
the Spirit of the Renaissance set free
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>the imagination of the artists, and kindled
in them a more vivid interest in humanity,
even in natural scenery. The intellectual
freedom it brought belonged to every city
which it touched. It belonged above all to
Venice. The spirit of a sea-people is by
nature more free than the spirit of the
people of the plains. It is as free as the
spirit of a mountain folk. And such a spirit
entered into the painting of the artists of
Venice, as it did into the life of its citizens.
They painted with more boldness, originality
and fire than the inland schools. The
passion of the various, even of the reckless,
sea was in their heart. And this passion
was in tune with the intellectual freedom
the New Learning brought to Venice.</p>

<p>As to the softness which distinguished
the Venetians, it was chiefly shown in a
passion for various, noble, and harmonized
colour, suffused, even to its darkest shadow,
with soft and glowing light. And Venice
was already, from its eastern associations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>the lover of rich colour, softly gradated, in
buildings, boats, and dress. And then, beyond
this, the colour of its seas and skies,
as indeed always near the southern coasts,
was tender, subtle, delicate alike when it
was strong or evanescent, soft as a child’s
cheek in slumber, but always glowing. Day
by day, this warm softness of colour was
instilled into the artists and nourished by
the sea-nature of the place. It was a spirit
in their pallet and their pencil.</p>

<p>The capacity for receiving such an impression
was strengthened by the circumstances
under which it was received. There
is no place where the reception of the elements
of beauty derived from Nature is so
easy, undistracted, and uninterrupted as
in Venice. Gliding in a gondola is very
different from riding, driving, or walking.
It ministers to receptivity.</p>

<p>Then there is the deep silence of the
lagoon, in which the spirit of Nature most
speaks to man, not only by night but by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>day. We may be as quiet on the Venetian
lagoons—with all the sense of sight open
to receive, with the soul undisturbed by the
challenge of human sounds—as we should
be in the heart of a Highland glen. All that
Nature displays of colour, form, or fancy;
her mystery, her wild or mocking charm,
her solemn silence fraught with thought—sinks
deep into the heart when sunrise or
sunset or starlight find us far out on the
lagoon. A whole boatful of gay people are
hushed as by a spell. This ease, then, in the
reception of impressions on the senses, the
quietude in which they are received, the
soft magic in the quietude, the freedom of
the waters, filled the soul of the Venetian
artists, and made, as it were, the atmosphere
which their art breathed, and the
inner spirit of their pictures. It was one of
the forces which made their work not only
softer and freer, but more vivid and passionate
than that of any other school in Italy.</p>

<p>Again, every one knows that the Venetian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>painters brought colour to a greater perfection
than it attained elsewhere. It came to
them from the lavish colouring of the city
of which I have already written, from the
gorgeousness of the pageants, but chiefly
from the natural scenery of their home. It is
true, they painted man rather than Nature.
But they felt her loveliness, and the deepest
impression they received from her daily work
was of the glory and ravishment, glow and
depth of colour, varied from the most delicate
to the most sombre hues in sea and
sky and along the distant range of Alpine
summits. In the city itself, from canal to
canal, all the shadows are transfused with
a glimmer of blue light, or full of crimson
and green fire. It is the presence and power
of the water which produces this. Over the
sea, the blue of the waters is like that of
the sapphire throne Ezekiel saw above the
terrible crystal of the firmament. It is not
terrible here, but deep and tender; and,
when storm is at hand, of a purple so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>solemn that Tintoret often uses it for the
garments of those in tragic sorrow. But it
was chiefly on the lagoon that the artists
saw the richest and softest colour. In subdued
sunlight, such as is frequent in the
haze of the sea, the soft silvery, pearly
grays vary infinitely over the smooth waters.
In fresher and brighter days when the wind
brings the flying clouds, the colour is that
which is native to a sea-atmosphere, often
clear, often thrilling through veils of ruby,
sapphire, and emerald vapour, steeped always
in the diffused light which is felt,
like joy, over wide spaces of water, and
under a vast expanse of sky. To these constant
impressions we owe in part the extraordinary
luminousness, glow, interfusion,
subtlety, tenderness, splendour in height
and depth of colour in the pictures of the
great Venetians.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of Venetian painting
is also derived from the charming of
the sea. It is the intense glow of the flesh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>colour. The deep warmth and ruddy light
which seem to come from within the body
to the skin in the figures of these painters,
were studied direct from Nature. It is the
colour of the naked body of the Venetian
fishers to this day. And nothing that I
know of produces it but the influence of
the sea-winds combined with sunlight, and
of the sunlight reflected from the waters in
a soft and gracious climate. We may see
something like this colour, in its coarse
extreme, in the faces and hands of the boatmen
on our coasts. Sea and sun have there
worked with a fierce and racking climate to
produce the colour, but to destroy its beauty
by destroying the texture of the skin. But,
at Venice, these natural forces work in a
climate which does not injure the skin; and
they overlay its surface with a glow of red
and golden colour which is one of the loveliest
hues in the world, and has the special
qualities of depth and life, even of a certain
passion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>
<p>There is more opportunity in Venice for
its formation than in other southern sea-ports.
All through the summer and autumn
the Venetian youths of the people spend
their time all but naked in the water. They
walk, ankle-deep, over the shallows of the
lagoons, fishing for sea-plunder. The men
work on the embankments only in their
shirts. Half their life they are practically
naked;—and to look at one of these young
Venetian fishers, standing in the blaze of
the sun, with the greenish water glistening
round him, its reflections playing on his
glowing limbs, and all his body flaming soft
as from an inward fire—is to see the very
thing which Giorgione painted on the walls
of palaces, which Bellini and Giorgione
handed on to their followers, which Titian
and Tintoret laid on their canvas and
emblazoned in their fresco. They worked
into their painting of the human body
what they saw every day, and other schools
of art did not attain the glory of flesh-colour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>Venice attained, because they did
not see it.</p>

<p>The naked body of the Bacchus of Tintoret,
who comes wading through the lagoon
water to meet Ariadne, is differently, but
as richly and nobly, coloured as that of the
Bacchus of Titian in the National Gallery.
Reflections from the water glow and quiver
on his limbs. He is truly a creature of dew
and fire. There is a young and naked St.
Sebastian by Titian at the Salute which
might stand for one of the fishers of the
lagoon. His long wet hair streams dark on
his shoulders. In his face is all the freedom
of the sea, and the soft warm rich glow of
his body and limbs is indescribable. He is
not St. Sebastian, but one of the gods of
the peaceful sea.</p>

<p>When Giovanni Bellini painted the naked
body, there is nothing better in colour in
the whole world. In San Grisostomo the
Saint sits in front of the bending stem of a
great fig tree, on which he rests his book.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>His white beard flows down over his breast.
Bellini’s certainty, firmness, enduringness
of colour, are here at their very best. The
glow and subdued flaming of the flesh,
varied from point to point with an exquisite
joy in the work, is beautiful beyond all
praise. The glow of Giorgione’s flesh-colour
is as deep, but thrilled through with a
greater softness. In Tintoret’s hands the
flesh-colour became more sombre, and in
the faces of his many portraits had a curious
dignity, as if, I have often thought, the
royalty of the Sun had entered into it.</p>

<p>With his women, a difference arose. At
first he painted them in the full Venetian
manner. But afterwards, with his impatience
of monotony or repetition, he changed
the type. It alters from the full, opulent,
rose-coloured women of Titian, Palma, Veronese,
to a lithe, lissome, tall, rather thin
woman, alive with youthful energy of fire,
of the most gracious and subtle curves, exquisitely
made, with a small head and lovely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>face. With his invention of this type, he invented
a new method of colouring, marked
by a temperance in its use and glow which
is strange in one so often accused, and
sometimes guilty, of intemperance. He sent
across the naked body alternate shafts of
sunlight and of shade, and amused himself
by painting the colour of flesh under these
varied conditions. The result—since in all
the shadow as in the light there was colour,
and colour at its subtlest—is the loveliest,
freest, and most delightful thing in Venetian
art. “The Graces” in the Ducal Palace
are an example of this. Any one can see
another example in the picture of the
“Origin of the Milky Way” in the National
Gallery. It may be only a fancy of mine,
but I cannot help thinking that Tintoret
had seen such girls bathing from the Lido
on days when the sunlight was broken over
the sea by racing clouds. There is a
freshness, an open-air purity and light
in these images of his which it pleases me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>to think would be absent if these lovely
bodies had been painted in the rooms of
palaces or in their gardens. The winds of
heaven appear to blow around them from
the unencumbered sea. The light of an
ocean sky, the dance of reflected light from
moving water seem to play upon them.</p>

<p>Again, the Venetian painters saw day by
day the human body in graceful and incessantly
changing movement, and the charm
of it was derived from the sea-life of Venice.
There are few attitudes and movements in
any human work more graceful than those
of the single rower of a gondola. He is so
placed, and his peculiar method of rowing
is such, that his labour educates him in
lovely movement, and of movement altering
almost at every instant to meet new
circumstances. He is unable to take an
awkward attitude. If he does, so lightly
poised is he, he is tossed out of the boat;
and it is only, I believe, because the attitudes
are so various, so momentary, so hard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>to see before they change, that sculptors
have not reproduced them. It is plain that
this incessantly beautiful movement of the
human body had a great influence on the
painters of Venice. Their eye was unconsciously
trained from youth to realize the
body of man in lovely poise and change.</p>

<p>Their eye was also trained to realize the
aspect of stately, grave, and reverent signiors
and merchants in the rich robes of
the days of pageants; or in the quiet robes
of councillors and citizens; and there are
no more noble, dignified representations of
men of honour, weight, and civic business,
than those made by the Venetian artists.
The only way in which this view of their
art can be connected with the sea is that,
owing to the commerce of Venice on every
sea, there existed in the town a wise, wealthy,
honoured middle class, different from the
middle class in the other sea-towns of Italy,
having worthy connections with the East,
and sharing in a greater degree than elsewhere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>in the government and culture of the
city.</p>

<p>Moreover, the wonderful splendour of the
pageants and triumphs of the town, most
of which were bound up with the sea, enabled
painters like Gentile Bellini, Carpaccio,
and Veronese, to display in decorative
art the most gorgeous colour in dress and
festive show. The processions in Venice,
the festal days at the Salute and the Redentore,
the marriage of Venice to the sea,
were a varied blaze of radiant colour.</p>

<p>Finally, on this matter of painting, there
are very few direct representations of sea-scenery
in Venetian art. I have said that
Titian painted the woods, rocks, and mountains
of his native Cadore. Once only, if I remember
rightly, he drew the lagoon and the
plain below the Alps, and Antelao above the
mist, soaring as if it would pierce the very
rampart of heaven. Every day and evening
he saw, from his garden at Casa Grande,
the lagoon near San Michele filled with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>joyous gondolas and alive with light and
colour, but it never occurred to him to
paint it. The mountain valleys, their groves
and torrents were his home. They did not
permit him, in their jealousy, to perceive
the sea.</p>

<p>Only one among the greater Venetian
painters seems to have cared at all, and
that very little, for the sea in the lagoons—and
he lived all his life in Venice. This
was Tintoret. Sometimes, as in one of the
Halls of the Ducal Palace, the background
of his picture is made by the green waves of
the lagoon beating on its scattered islands,
or in another picture by the glittering surface
of its water with the boats crimson in
the sunlight. The green sea of the lagoon,
prankt with flitting azures, soft, and shot
with changing hues, is painted by him with
a rapturous pleasure in his picture of Bacchus
and Ariadne. A sea-going ship with
its sails set is making its way, behind the
figures, out to Malamocco. There is a picture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>of his in Santa Maria Zobenigo where
St. Justina and Augustine are kneeling on
the seashore, and the gray-blue lagoon, in
short leaping waves, is enriched by the
scarlet sail of a Venetian bark. The sea
in the St. George in the National Gallery
breaks in low waves of bluish green, edged
with foam, gloomy under a dark sky, upon
a desolate coast. It is as like the water of
the lagoon when storm is drawing near
as it can be painted. Then he painted on
the ceiling of the great hall in the Ducal
Palace, Venice enthroned as the Queen of
the Sea. A huge, globed surge of oceanic
power and mass rises at her feet, and on
it are afloat the sea-gods and goddesses,
Tritons and monsters of the deep who bring
the gifts of the sea to the feet of the Sea-Queen.
It might be an illustration of the
subject of this Essay, and it proves that the
subject was not unconceived by Tintoret.</p>

<p>Indeed, if the soaring figure, which in
the picture of the Paradise at the Ducal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>Palace, rises with uplifted arms and face
from the angle above the Chair of the Doge
as he sat in council, towards the figure of
Christ at the summit of the canvass, be in
truth, as some have conjectured, the Angel
of the Sea, whose nursling was Venice—Tintoret,
setting this incarnation of the
history of the city above its senate in
council, among the saintly host, and aspiring
to the throne of God, did most nobly
and religiously conceive the sea as the
mother and guard and glory of Venice.</p>

<p>But more remarkable than these few
reminiscences of the sea were the skies
which Tintoret painted from those he saw
over the sea and the lagoon. Sometimes
the sky is pure, but the blue is full of white
light, such as the sea mists make when they
rise into the heaven. Sometimes his sky is
full of dark gray cloud, threatening ruin
or heavy sorrow. When Christ descends
through the sky to welcome his martyrs or
answer the prayers of Venice, he bursts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>through the clouds as through a sea, and
they ripple away from Him in rosy concentric
circles. It is an effect he may have
seen from a seashore, but not on land.
But, chiefly, with his stormy and stern nature,
Tintoret—who had seen the skies of
Venice when the tempest had come in from
the sea—filled his heaven, especially when
he paints the tragedies of earth, with the
heavy bars of purple, mingled with angry
gold which I have often seen after a thunderstorm
at Venice, descending like stairs
from the zenith to the horizon. And once
at least, below the clouds, he has painted
the lagoon, black and tortured by the wind.</p>

<p>I have said nothing of Canaletto or of
Guardi. They seem to belong to another
world than that of the great Venetians.
But it would be uncourteous to omit them.
Canaletto, or Il Canale, was really fond of
the waters of Venice, much fonder of them
than his predecessors were; and when he
painted the long reaches of the Grand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>Canal, he managed to represent one aspect
at least of that wonderful sea-street, when
under a faint wind it trembles into multitudinous
small curving ripples that annihilate
all reflections. He does not often
vary from this, and when he varies he does
not succeed so well. But he painted the
buildings with a real desire to impress us
with their nobility and largeness of design,
with no special care for accuracy of detail,
but with great care to give fully a sense of
their splendour of situation and of architecture.
And he drew over the scene—and
this he did excellently—a clear, pure, luminous,
tenderly gradated, but rather hard
atmosphere, in which the buildings were
frankly visible, and the waters almost austere.
The pictures are so decorative that
many of them tend to weary the eyes, and
we turn with some relief to those other
pictures of his in which the sky is dark,
and a more grave and homelier representation
is made of the Venice of his time. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>have not seen any pictures by him of the
lagoons. But I have seen a set of drawings
of the islands in the lagoon done in Indian
ink, which in their slight and careless
drawing pleased me because he seemed to
love what he was doing, and to feel delicately
the magical reflectiveness and charm
of the waters of the lagoon.</p>

<p>Guardi cares more than Il Canale for the
waters of Venice. He did his best to represent
their lovely trembling in the light,
and the images they made in their mirror
of the buildings above them and of the life
which moves upon them. It is easy, when
one does not require the best, to admire,
even to have a special liking for, his pictures.
As to what the moderns have done
for the Venetian waters, what the sea-charm
of the city has impelled on their
canvas—it would require an essay as long
as this to tell the tale of it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>These things, with regard to Venetian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>painting, are part of the charm which the
sea exercised on the artists. One other
charm is also derived from the sea. The
sea and its life have largely made the
character of the Venetian people. That is
too great a matter to discuss fully, but if
those who visit Venice will make friends
with the fisher people, they will soon discover
the historical character of the Venetian
people as distinguished from the upper
classes. It is salted with the nature of the
sea. A wild, free, open, dashing, quiet and
tempestuous character, too much the sport
of circumstance and impulse, yet capable of
a steady exercise of power when it loves or
desires greatly—it is the human image of
the sea on which they live. It is one of the
pleasantest charms of Venice to know it,
and be friends with it.</p>

<p>It is always a romantic character, and
the sea has always fathered its romance.
The history of the city, legendary and actual,
is steeped in the romance of the sea.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>Wherever we wander through the town, in
the churches, by the monuments, squares,
bridges and quays, among the islands in
the lagoon, on the sea-beaten sand of the
Lido, when we hear the beat of the hammers
in the Arsenal, in the very names of
the streets—we meet the sea, and stories
of the sea, and have all the pleasure and
charm a boy has when he reads of ocean
adventure, and feels on his cheek the salt
wind from the sea. I will only take one
well-known example. Walking in the neighbourhood
of the Church of Santa Maria
Formosa, I happened to look up to the name
of the street. It was called after the guild
of workers who made the bridal chests and
jewel boxes for the Venetian maidens. It
was here they lived and wrought. But they
were not only workmen, but sailors trained
for war. And as I saw the name, I remembered
the story of the brides of Venice,
twelve of whom were each year, on the
Feast of the Purification, dowered by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>State. It happened one year that pirates
from Trieste, knowing this custom, stole in
at night to the Island of San Pietro di
Castello, and hid in the low bushes near
the water. When the brides, carrying their
boxes of gems and money, were among the
peaceful throng in the Church, these bold
bad men seized them and bore them away
to the port of Caorle, and there, landing
with the spoil, lit their fires and took to
feasting. All Venice rose to pursue them,
but the Chest and Box-Makers were the
first, with that fierce swiftness which belonged
to Venetian war, to take to their
boats and pursue the ravishers; and outsailing
all the rest, rescued the damsels and
slew the villains as they were drinking
round their fires. Returning with the rest,
the Doge Candiano asked them what reward
they would have from the State—and they
answered: “Only that the Doge should visit
in procession their Church of Santa Maria
Formosa on the anniversary of the Day of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>the Brides.” Everywhere in the city such
romantic stories spring up from church and
square, palace and bridge; and their historical
charm is born of the sea.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may write a little word
on the sensational charm of Venice seated
in the hearing of the sea waves, and adorned
for worship by the beauty of her water-world.
The word sensational here brings
no reproach; it only means that the vivid
impressions made on the senses are more
numerous, varied, and intense in Venice
than elsewhere. Each of them is accompanied
with a spiritual passion as intense
as the sensible impression. The imagination
is incessantly kindled into creation by
what it sees.</p>

<p>I will bring together, to illustrate this,
what I saw in one day when I went to
Torcello. We started early, on a lovely
morning. As we rounded the angle of Murano
we saw far away, and filling the line
of the horizon, the rare vision of the peaks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>of the Dolomites. Snow lay on them, but
snow transfigured by distance into ethereal
light. Fine bars of vapour lay across them,
floating free, as if they were the battlements
of fairyland. Below, their buttresses and
flanks fell into the plain, blue as the heaven
above them. Seen thus, across the dazzling
lagoon, they made that impression of farness
and mystery, of a land of enchanting
secrets, of ethereal hope taking ethereal
form, which is part of the magic which
rises like a wizard vapour from the lagoons.
The mountain glory is transfigured into a
spiritual glory, and the soul loses its conscious
life in a drift of dreams.</p>

<p>Then, through the winding of the dark
piles, through the shallows haunted by sea
birds, we came to Torcello. Torcello has
been described by a master hand, and I will
not follow him; but when we had visited
the well-known places we went down along
the banks to the large arm of the sea beside
the island. There was not a sound,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>save the cry of a scythe in the coarse
reeds, as we sat on the flowery grass. The
place was once full of human life, of wealth,
and labour; it was now the very home of
desolation. Deep sadness—the sense of all
the might and splendour of the earth passing
away into the elements, of nature only
living, and living in regret—filled the heart.
And the sensation was as different from that
with which we had begun the day, as the
glory of the mountains was from the wild
sea-marsh where we sat, and the sorrowful
salt water stealing by.</p>

<p>We left Torcello and went on to Burano,
a small island about a mile from Torcello.
The men are fishers, the women lace-makers.
A few canals traverse it, and it has a large
population. It belongs to itself alone, and
the indwellers have kept their distinct type
for centuries. For centuries they have been
poor, rough, and helpful to one another. A
British working man would think their life
starvation. It is an austere struggle for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>existence; but on the day I went to see them
they had a festa. Baldassare Galuppi, whom
Browning celebrated, was a native of the
island, and this was his centenary. To honour
this half-genius all the inhabitants cheerfully
struck work, and turned out in their
best array. The canals, the streets, were
crowded; the market-place was full of booths
and rejoicing folk. In the church the
preacher was improving the occasion. A
local poet had written a sonnet on Galuppi,
and it was hung up at the corner of every
street. Illustrated broadsheets with Galuppi’s
portrait and his life were sold on
every stall; the men and women were singing
snatches from his music. A cripple, on
gigantic crutches, seized hold of me and
carried me off to the Municipio to show me
the musician’s bust, as excited as the rest
of the crowd to celebrate the artist of their
town. We forgot the mountains, we forgot
Torcello, in the gaiety, brightness, good
humour, and artistic excitement of humanity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>Nothing can well be more wretchedly
poor than the life of these hard-working
people, and yet, to celebrate one dead for a
hundred years, every memory of their
misery perished in pleasant joy.</p>

<p>When we left Burano we rowed on another
mile to visit the Island of St. Francis
in the Desert. Ever since the fourteenth
century, with a few intervals, it has been
held by the Franciscans. A marble wall
surrounds the tiny island, a marble pavement
leads up to the small convent with its
church and garden. Cypresses and tall
poplars stand in the garden, and one stone
pine looks out from the corner of the wall
over the waste lagoon. It is a solitary and
lovely place, like an island in the sea of
the world.</p>

<p>We found service going on; the little bell
was ringing, and we knelt among the monks.
All the spirit of the silence, of the peace of
obedience, chastity, and poverty, of the
love that ruled St. Francis, fell upon us.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>The depth of the religious life was here. I
looked up as I knelt, and saw, rudely painted
on the wall, the charming legend of the place—how
St. Francis, returning from the East,
took boat at Venice to reach the mainland,
and as night fell was drifted to this island,
slept, and woke in the morning among the
low bushes which clothed its shore. And as
the sun rose he began to chant the Matins.
But who, said he, will sing the responses?
At which all the little birds came flocking
into the bushes, and when he paused sang
the responses for him.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And Francis, rejoicing,
struck his staff into the ground,
and it became a tree where the birds had
plenteous shelter. Part of the trunk of that
tree is still kept in the cloister—small and
poor, paved with brick, and a deep well in
the centre. Vervain and roses and balsams
grew round its low pillars in pots of red
earthenware, and the scent of them was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>sweet and solitary. And we forgot the noise
and excitement of Burano, and remembered
only the peaceful sainthood of the
world, and the secret of obedience, and the
love of God to poverty.</p>

<p>When we left the island the sun had
set over the Euganean Hills, and again,
as in the morning, but of how different a
note, a new impression out of the life of
Nature was made upon us. We rowed in
silence through the teaching of evening.
And when night came and the only light
was the light of stars, the silence deepened
into mystery. There is a sense of the infinite
on the lagoon at night, and speech seems
to break its spell. It is half awe, half
pleasure; the excitement it brings is not
for words; it is translated within into
the language of the personal soul, the
tongue which no one knows but one’s self
alone.</p>

<p>This was our day. There is no other
place I know of where so many varied impressions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>may be awakened in the imagination.
They are bound up with the sea
and their charm is from the sea.</p>
